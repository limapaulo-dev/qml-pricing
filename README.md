This project was my first attempt of coding a usable UI. <br>
Before this one all my projects were IDE and console based.

Choosing QML was not the best decision but It still helped me start
to grasp UI/UX basice concepts.

It was also my first time using JavaScript since QML
provides native JS support. 

HTML/CSS would've being a more preferable solution. <br>
Still, I'm glad for sticking to it and coding a usable software :)

Totally unnecessary but I wanted to keep the project color identity for topbar.
