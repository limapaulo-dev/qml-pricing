This project was my first attempt of coding a usable UI.
Before this all my projects were IDE and console based.

QML was not the best decision but It still helped me start
to grasp UI/UX basice concepts.

It was also my first time using JavaScript since QML
provides native JS support. 

HMTL/CSS wouldÂ´ve beeing a more prefareble solution. 
Still, I'm glad I stick to it and coded a usable software :)

Totally unecessary but I wanted to keep the project color edentity 
for topbar.
